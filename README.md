## Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm Kazi Shakib from Bangladesh. As Founder & CEO of Dummy Marketorr, I'm a passionate learner, builder and traveller, always exploring new ideas to bridge technology, finance and strategy.

My journey blends technical foundations like HTML, C, C++ and Python with a strong push for smart thinking and real results. I really love AI and use it every day for things like making websites, learning faster, automating tasks and more. I've also published some articles on topics like AI, marketing, strategy, prompting, business and numbers (data & analytics).

I've been a leader as Campus Ambassador for the ICT Olympiad Bangladesh and Section Representative for the BAF Shaheen College Business Club. I also won the Education Olympiad & Scholarship Examination Award.

Deep down, I grow by always learning to create new things like online tools or my own skills. Traveling helps me see different views and turn them into simple steps for lasting success.

I'm excited to team up with people who think like me to make useful changes based on facts.
